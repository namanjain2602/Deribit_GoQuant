# GoQuant - Order Execution and Management System (OEMS) using Deribit API

## Overview

**GoQuant OEMS** is a cutting-edge C++17 application created to interface with the Deribit cryptocurrency trading platform. It offers an array of trading functions, such as placing, modifying, and canceling orders, along with managing open orders and positions, and fetching order books. Additionally, it features a WebSocket server to allow clients to subscribe to specific symbols and receive continuous updates on the order book.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/namanjain2602/Deribit_GoQuant.git
cd Deribit_GoQuant
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install `vcpkg` (if not already installed):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```
2. Install required packages:

```bash
./vcpkg install drogon curl openssl jsoncpp
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` and `your_secret_key` with your Deribit API credentials.

### Step 4: Configure CMake

Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file with the following content:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(GoQuantOEMS)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

# Set VCPKG
set(CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake)
set(VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET "x64-linux")

# Find required packages
find_package(Drogon REQUIRED)
find_package(CURL REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)

# Specify the path to the JsonCpp package
set(JsonCpp_DIR "/home/naman/Deribit_GoQuant/vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/share/jsoncpp")
find_package(JsonCpp REQUIRED CONFIG)

# Add executable
add_executable(goquant_oems
    GoQuantApp/main.cpp
    GoQuantApp/web_socket_client.cpp
    GoQuantApp/order_manager.cpp
    GoQuantApp/utility_manager.cpp
    GoQuantApp/token_manager.cpp
    GoQuantApp/api_credentials.cpp
)

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(goquant_oems Drogon::Drogon ${CURL_LIBRARIES} ${OPENSSL_LIBRARIES} JsonCpp::JsonCpp)
```

### Step 5: Build the Project

1. Create a `build` directory in the project folder:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Run the CMake configuration command:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
make
```

### Step 6: Run the Project

Run the `goquant_oems` executable generated by the build process:
```bash
./goquant_oems
```

## Usage

### Example Input Orders for Each Action

Here are example input orders to use with each of the choices available in the program:

1. **Place Order**
   - **Action**: `Buy`
   - **Instrument Name**: `ETH-PERPETUAL`
   - **Amount**: `1`
   - **Price**: `2500.0`
   - **Order Type**: `LIMIT`
   - **Client id**: `MyFirstOrder`

2. **Cancel Order**
   - **Order ID**: `1234-5678-ABCD`

3. **Modify Order**
   - **Order ID**: `1234-5678-ABCD`
   - **New Amount**: `0.2`
   - **New Price**: `45500.0`

4. **Get Order Book**
   - **Instrument Name**: `BTC-PERPETUAL`

5. **Get Current Positions**
   - **Currency**: `BTC`
   - **Kind**: `future`

6. **Get Open Orders**
   - No additional inputs required.

7. **Connect to WebSocket and Subscribe**
   - **Symbol**: `ETH-PERPETUAL`

## Environment Variables

- **API_KEY:** Your Deribit API key.
- **SECRET_KEY:** Your Deribit API secret key.

## Error Handling

The application handles various errors, such as failed order placements or WebSocket reconnections. Errors are logged and printed to the console.

In case of an error such as `Failed to find access_token.txt`, clone the repository again. From the "Deribit_GoQuant/out/build/x64-Debug" directory, copy and store the `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `api_key`, and `api_secret` text files. After reconfiguring CMake, paste them back.
